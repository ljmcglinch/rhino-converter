"""A coarse spatial index over one mesh's primitives, for picking.

Deciding what a click landed on means testing the cursor against geometry,
and that test is linear in the amount of geometry. Narrowing the drawing to
the objects near the cursor deals with a scene of many small objects. It
does nothing for the other shape a drawing takes: a scanned survey mesh
that is one object of three million triangles, where "the object near the
cursor" is the whole model.

So each big mesh gets its primitives sorted into a coarse grid, with a
bounding box kept per occupied cell. The pick then rejects cells the same
way it rejects objects — by projecting the box and missing the cursor — and
only tests the primitives in what survives.

The index is deliberately one level deep. A full BVH would query in
log(n) rather than in "n cells", but n cells is a few thousand boxes tested
in one array operation, and the build stays a sort instead of a recursion.
