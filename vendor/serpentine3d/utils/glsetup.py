"""The two GL decisions that can only be made at one moment each.

Both of them are about agreeing with the driver before anything draws,
and both have exactly one window in the startup sequence in which they
can still be made: the surface format before the QApplication exists,
the PyOpenGL binding after it does but before the viewport is imported.
That is why they live here and not in the viewport, which the launcher
will not import until the splash is up (it drags the geometry kernel in
behind it).

Neither of them mattered while everyone was on GLX. On EGL, which is
what Wayland gives you, both are the difference between an app and a
window full of nothing.

    PyOpenGL picks a binding once, when `OpenGL.platform` is imported,
    from the environment: EGL if the session says Wayland, GLX
    otherwise. Qt picks its own by asking the driver. Everything
    PyOpenGL does per context - keeping an array alive across a
    `glVertexAttribPointer`, caching an extension lookup - it keys on
    that binding's idea of the current context, so when the two
    disagree it sees no context at all, and the first GL call raises
    "Attempt to retrieve context when no valid context" from inside
    `initializeGL`. That surfaces as a hundred frames of "Error calling
    Python override of ..." and a viewport that never draws.

    They disagree in both directions - X11 where Qt went to EGL, and a
    Wayland session that fell back to XWayland and GLX - so the answer
    is stated either way rather than left to agree by luck.
